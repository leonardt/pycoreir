Ultralight Python bindings for [coreir](https://github.com/rdaly525/coreir) using ctypes.

```
pip install coreir
```

The Python package comes with a wheel that contains a pre-built CoreIR binary supporting manylinux and MacOS.  If the package finds a pre-existing installation of CoreIR (e.g. compiled from source), it will default to using that rather than the shipped binary (this enables you to override the package binary if, for example, you're using a development version to test a new feature).

[CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md)

# Development Setup
Install a local working copy to your python packages using
```
pip install -e .
```
**NOTE:** When working with an editable link, as of 7/31/19, `pip uninstall
coreir` will not correctly remove the installed script (see
https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/5997), a workaround is to remove the scrip
manually when uninstalling, (e.g. `rm ~/miniconda3/bin/coreir`)

To run the tests
```
pip install pytest
pytest
```
